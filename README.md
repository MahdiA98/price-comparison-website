# Price Comparison Website
Built in Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript in Netbeans 8.2 and Visual Studio Code.

Developed as part of my summative assignment, for the 'Advanced Web Development with Big Data' module.

## Description
A price comparison website centred around video games. User is able to navigate the website and explore the various prices for individual titles. Clicking on said title, presents the price tags from the other websites (if applicable). Buttons also displayed that acts as a filter for the gaming platforms. Additionally, a search bar is provided to narrow down a specific product.  

It uses web scraping, in order to retrieve and store data from third party websites, into a database created within HeidiSQL. This is then delivered to the client-side through the use of AJAX.
