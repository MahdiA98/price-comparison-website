## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This project was built as part of my assignment in the 'Advanced Web Development with Big Data' module. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Data is collected from third-party websites using Web-scraping and stored within a database. This is then displayed to the user when initializing the front-end website, allowing them to compare prices of a certain video game from several websites.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Search for video games using the search bar, located at the top header section of the website. 

Click on the video game to be directed to and displayed with the comparison prices from other websites (if available). Links to the external website provided if the user would like to inquire even further.

Navigate through the pages using the pagination numbers at the bottom of the website.
